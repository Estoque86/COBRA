# link section defines point-to-point links between nodes and characteristics of these links
link

# Each line should be in the following format (only first two are required, the rest can be omitted)
# srcNode   dstNode     bandwidth   metric  delay   queue
# bandwidth: link bandwidth
# metric: routing metric
# delay:  link delay
# queue:  MaxPackets for transmission queue on the link (both directions)
